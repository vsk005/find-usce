The sponsoring physician must then obtain approval from the relevant residency or fellowship program director. After this, the program director or coordinator will contact the Medical Education Office for final approval and onboarding. There is a very restrictive policy for international medical students seeking elective rotations, requiring them to be a former employee or have an immediate family member who is a current or former employee/volunteer; it is unclear if this applies to medical graduates seeking observerships."

    "observershipNotes": "UAMS Northwest does not have a formal observership program for IMGs and their policy excludes graduate-status individuals from official observerships. However, their FAQ page states that individual clinicians in Northwest Arkansas and at their main participating hospital, Mercy Northwest, may take observers. It is the individual's responsibility to make these arrangements. For shadowing at Washington Regional Medical Center, inquiries for internal medicine are directed to the UAMS / Washington Regional Internal Medicine Residency program."

    "observershipNotes": "There is no formally advertised observership program for international medical graduates (IMGs). The provided contact, Ellen Johnson, is listed for 'Affiliate International Medical Students' regarding clerkships/rotations. It is the most relevant contact for IMGs to inquire about any potential observership opportunities. Another potential contact for general visiting student inquiries is mdvsas@temple.edu. For post-graduate clinical rotators (residents/fellows from accredited programs), the contact is the Graduate Medical Education Department. For other inquiries, a written request can be sent to the GME Manager, Lioudmila Cruz, addressed to Susan Wiegers. A recent online discussion suggests that finding the correct contact for post-graduate IMG observerships at Temple can be difficult, as some information on the university's website may be outdated."

    "observershipNotes": "This contact is for the 'Accelerated Clinical Experience (ACE) Program' which is designed for graduating international medical students and recent international medical graduates. The program is 4 weeks long and can be extended. It provides clinical exposure, didactic lectures, and journal clubs. UC San Diego Health also has a general Observer Program, but it does not accept applications from students at international or off-shore medical schools for their visiting student program and does not facilitate introductions to hosting departments for observerships; applicants must find their own host. The Department of Psychiatry explicitly does not offer observerships."

The application process requires the observer to first contact and receive an acceptance letter from a host faculty or department at UCLA. Participation does not have any bearing on future residency applications, and the program is unable to provide letters of recommendation. Note: The user's query for a UCSF program in Los Angeles is contradictory, as UCSF is in San Francisco and generally does not accept international students for clinical experiences. The information provided is for the relevant program at UCLA in Los Angeles."
